Business scenario

There are various business problems to which the Analytic team of WeFit have to provide the solution. In this case study we will look at such scenarios and try to provide the solution for these problems.

 

1. A company called leanfit which is a daughter company of WeFit sells personalized diet plans and this company is generating less sales from the last few months and now they want the Analytics team to find some potential customers who are most likely to buy their personalized diet plans for weight loss.

People of all ages, genders, and body types may choose to purchase a weight loss diet plan. Some people may decide to purchase a weight loss diet plan because they are unhappy with their current weight or because they want to improve their overall health. Others may have a specific health condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, that can be improved by losing weight. Some people may also purchase a weight loss diet plan as part of a broader effort to improve their physical fitness or to train for a specific event, such as a marathon or a bodybuilding competition. In general, anyone who is interested in losing weight and improving their health may consider purchasing a weight loss diet plan.

Now we know that If your BMI is 18.5 to <25, it falls within the healthy weight range. If your BMI is 25.0 to <30, it falls within the overweight range. If your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the obesity range.

Elevated heart rate is associated with elevated blood pressure, increased risk for hypertension, and, among hypertensives, increased risk for cardiovascular disease.If your heart rate exceeds 185 beats per minute during exercise, it is dangerous for you. If you have high blood pressure, it is important to work with your healthcare team to develop a plan for managing your condition. This may include lifestyle changes, such as following a healthy diet and exercising regularly, as well as taking medications as prescribed. Weight loss can be an important part of this plan, and it is often recommended for people with hypertension.

Here I tried to find the customers who are likely to buy this weight loss plan, analyzing the data and found some potential customers for leanfit . 

 
2. A Company called fitwear which is a daughter company of WeFit. FitWear is a company that is dedicated to helping people stay active and comfortable while they work out. The company offers a wide range of fitness-related products, including workout clothes, shoes, and accessories. FitWear's goal is to create high-quality, stylish, and functional products that help people feel good about themselves and their workouts.
Currently, they are selling in their stores but now they are going online to sell all the products.
There are likely to be many different types of people who are interested in buying fitness gear online. Some may be individuals who are already very active and looking to upgrade or replace their existing gear, while others may be people who are just starting to get into fitness and looking for affordable equipment to use at home. 

Additionally, there may be people who are interested in purchasing fitness gear online because they live in an area where it is difficult to find the types of gear they are interested in or because they prefer the convenience of shopping online. 

Ultimately, the demographics of people who are most likely to buy fitness gear online may vary widely depending on the specific products being purchased and the marketing efforts of the retailers selling them.

Here I tried to find the customers who are likely to buy their products,analyzing the data and found some potential customers for fitwear. 

 

3. A Company called sleepy-nights which is a subsidiary of WeFit.

Sleepy-Nights is a company that is dedicated to helping people get the rest they need to feel their best. The company has developed a sleep scheduling app that helps people optimize their sleep cycles and get the most out of their time in bed.

The Sleepy-Nights app is designed to be easy to use and understand, and it can be customized to fit each user's unique needs and preferences. The app includes a variety of features that can help people improve their sleep, such as a sleep tracker, a sleep journal, and a sleep schedule planner.

Users of the Sleepy-Nights app can track their sleep patterns and habits, and use the data they collect to identify patterns and make adjustments to their sleep schedule. The app also includes resources and tips for improving sleep hygiene, such as recommendations for creating a comfortable sleep environment, setting a consistent bedtime routine, and managing stress and anxiety.

In addition to its sleep scheduling app, Sleepy-Nights also offers a range of sleep-related products, such as comfortable bedding, white noise machines, and relaxation aids. The company is committed to helping people get the rest they need to feel their best and perform at their best.

Sleepy-Nights sells subscriptions of their sleep scheduling app and wants to increase their subscribers.This app tracks your sleep patterns, provides personalized sleep insights, and includes a white noise generator to help you fall asleep. They want to target the customers who are not able to maintain their sleep schedules.

Here I tried to find the customers who are likely to buy their products,analyzing the data and found some potential customers for sleepy-nights. 

 

4. At last I created a dashboard out of this data .

First used the daily activity data and found the unique id of all the users.
Then find the number of days they use their fitness tracker in a month.
Use this data to group all the users into Active, moderate and light users.
After that find out the mean distance traveled by each user
Use this mean distance to group each user into Pro,Intermediate and beginner.
Then find out the total steps traveled by each user
Then find out the calories burned by each user
And then find out their fairly active, lightly active and Very active minutes.
Repeat all these tasks for different users with respect to distinct dates.
Use this filtered data to create charts and graphs for better visualization.
